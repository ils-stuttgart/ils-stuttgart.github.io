Aircraft maintenance interfaces are vital for diagnosing, updating, and maintaining various
systems, ensuring the safety and efficiency of aircraft operations. These interfaces, which
include the Secure Maintenance Interface (SMI), are responsible for managing ground-based
maintenance tasks, software updates, and system diagnostics. The SMI encompasses
functions such as the Maintenance Data Collection Function (MDCF), Diagnostic Function
(DF), and Software Update Function (SUF), all of which are crucial for aircraft upkeep.

However, cybersecurity threats targeting these maintenance interfaces posing risks to flight
safety, operational integrity, and data confidentiality. These threats could lead to data
manipulation, unauthorized updates, or malware introduction, jeopardizing the entire aircraft
system. Traditional encryption methods are becoming inadequate due to advancements in
quantum computing, which can break conventional cryptographic algorithms and expose
aircraft maintenance interfaces to cyber threats.

This research proposes the integration of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to secure data
transmission within SMI. QKD enhances MDCF by encrypting diagnostic and maintenance
data, preventing tampering. It strengthens DF by ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of
software updates. Additionally, it secures SUF by protecting data exchanges during ground
maintenance from cyberattacks using QKD-based encryption.

Although QKD integration in maintenance interfaces offers significant benefits, it also presents
challenges. These include the need for specialized quantum hardware, potential impacts on
aircraft weight and efficiency, and compatibility with existing maintenance protocols. Despite
these obstacles, implementing QKD in aircraft maintenance interfaces marks a pivotal step in
aviation cybersecurity. Ongoing research and development are essential to optimize system
performance and reduce implementation costs. They also ensure seamless integration into
future aircraft designs, safeguarding aviation against evolving cyber threats in the quantum
era.

In this presentation, we present approach to securing aircraft maintenance interfaces using
QKD. Our contribution includes analyzing security vulnerabilities, proposing QKD-based
encryption solutions, and assessing their effectiveness against cyber threats. By integrating
QKD, we enhance the security of maintenance data access, software updates, and ground-to-
aircraft communication. The findings demonstrate the feasibility of QKD in aviation
cybersecurity, paving the way for more resilient and future-proof maintenance systems.
